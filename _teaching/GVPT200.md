I taught an introductory International Relations course synchronously online in Summer 2025. 
The course introduced students to core concepts in the field, including statehood, anarchy, security dilemmas, and the foundations of game theory, while also engaging with contemporary issues such as climate politics, international institutions, and the return of great power rivalry. 
To bridge theory and practice, I incorporated interactive simulations that placed students in the role of decision-makers, allowing them to experience firsthand the dynamics of the prisonerâ€™s dilemma, the challenges of collective action, and the complexities of conflict negotiation. 
These activities encouraged students to connect abstract theories to real-world political challenges, while developing analytical and collaborative skills.
