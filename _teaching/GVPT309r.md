I developed this course with the aim to teach students about the history and development of human rights through the lens of the
United Nations as an institution. The course will track how the UN formalizes and promotes human rights through
treaties and bodies under the UN umbrella. The course will also discuss how these norms disperse informally
between states as well as domestically. Students will leave the course with the ability to identify and assess the
efficacy of current international efforts to promote human rights through international organizations. Taught Asynchronously Summer 2024.
