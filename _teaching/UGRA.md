This course allowed high-performing students to develop and execute their research projects under the mentorship of a faculty member. I facilitated class meetings, lecturing the students on research design. I also held individual meetings with students to discuss their progress and provide feedback. Through this course, I am able to mentor a diverse group of students from project inception to completion and presentation in front of faculty and peers. I have taught in this position since Fall 2023.
